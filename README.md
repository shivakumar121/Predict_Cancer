## Predict Cancer Using Images of Cells

Microscopic images of cells were used to calculate features. The features described overall morphology of the cells and its components. The images are classified as *malignant* or *benign*. XGBoost was used to train model based on these features to automatically classify these images. 

The data came from [this website.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

You can explore the jupyter notebook that describes the analysis and the model using [this link.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shivakumar121/Predict_Cancer/blob/master/Wisconsin_Breast_Cancer_Data_1.ipynb)
